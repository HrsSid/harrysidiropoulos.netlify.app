                <h1 class="Skills-Screen-Description">I was first introduced to <span class="Special-Color">HTML</span> at mt school on 2020-2021. I later decided to learn <span class="Special-Color">web development</span>, so I went deeper into <span class="Special-Color">HTML</span> and learnt a bit more. I now have been using and practising <span class="Special-Color">HTML</span> 1 months!<br><br>With <span class="Special-Color">HTML</span> you need to know a programming language that helps with the styling of the page, there comes <span class="Special-Color">CSS</span>. In the first 4-5 days of learning <span class="Special-Color">HTML</span> I did not use any <span class="Special-Color">CSS</span>. That is because I wanted to first understand and remember some basics and learn some things I did not know already. After the first 4-5 days I began my <span class="Special-Color">CSS</span> research, in the first 6-7 days I knew some basics of both <span class="Special-Color">HTML</span> and <span class="Special-Color">CSS</span>!<br><br>I now can confidently say I know some decent <span class="Special-Color">CSS</span> and some decent <span class="Special-Color">HTML</span>, witch is something that makes me happy and proud of my self!<br><br>I do not only know <span class="Special-Color">HTML</span> and <span class="Special-Color">CSS</span> tho. I also know <span class="Special-Color">PYTHON</span> and I have quite the experience, since I have been learning <span class="Special-Color">PYTHON</span> for the last 6 years now! I lately have been working on command line based programmes and I love the command line environment!</h1>

                <h1 class="About-Me-Screen-Description">Hello, my name is <span class="Special-Color">Harrys Sidiropoulos</span>, I was born in 2008 and I am from greece. In my free time I like either programming using <span class="Special-Color">PYTHON</span> or <span class="Special-Color">HTML</span>+<span class="Special-Color">CSS</span>, playing video games like CS:GO and Minecraft and going out with my friends.<br><br>On 2017 I started learning <span class="Special-Color">PYTHON</span> and it was my first good communication with a computer. I lately started learning how to create websites, I currently know a decent amount of <span class="Special-Color">HTML</span> and <span class="Special-Color">CSS</span> but I can not say the same for <span class="Special-Color">JAVASCRIPT</span> as it is different from all the programming languages I know. But for my age I want to believe I know a satisfying amount of programming. I hope when I grow up I will be able to work as a web developer or a application developer for a full time job.</h1>
